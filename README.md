# GEC -AI

# Abstract
Grammatical Error Correction (GEC) represents a significant challenge in the field of Natural Language Processing (NLP). 
It is critical for a wide range of applications, from enhancing writing tools to improving language learning platforms. 
Our project aims to develop a cutting-edge GEC model that utilizes the expansive C4_200M Synthetic Dataset, which contains millions of instances of grammatically incorrect and corrected sentence pairs.
This project will explore the potential of machine learning algorithms to understand and rectify grammatical errors, thereby contributing to advancements in automated proofreading technology.

# Objectives
Our project is centered around the following objectives:
To harness the vast C4_200M Synthetic Dataset to train a robust GEC model that can understand the context and nuances of written language.
To evaluate and implement state-of-the-art NLP techniques, including transformers and sequence-to-sequence learning models, for effective error correction.
To benchmark the model's performance against current leading GEC frameworks, striving for superior accuracy and efficiency.
To ensure the model is scalable and adaptable, capable of processing large volumes of text with varying complexity.
To develop a user-friendly interface that can be integrated with writing platforms to provide real-time grammatical assistance.
Through these objectives, we aim to significantly reduce the barrier to clear and correct written communication across diverse domains.

# Approach
Data Preparation:
Thoroughly clean and preprocess the C4_200M Synthetic Dataset, ensuring data quality for training.

Model Selection:
Experiment with various architectures, including LSTMs and Transformer-based models like BERT, to identify the most effective framework.

Training & Fine-Tuning:
Employ sequence-to-sequence learning with attention mechanisms to train the model, fine-tuning on a subset of high-quality corrections.

Evaluation:
Utilize standard GEC metrics such as ERRANT and M^2 for detailed performance analysis.
